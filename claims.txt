Assembler-
The assembler:
    * uses a single routine for both passes.
    * detects errors related to nomenclature of labels
    * consistent and sensible formatting with sensible program structure. 
    * sensible variable, function & type names with explanatory comments.
	* produces a listing file.
	* assembles test programs.

Structure of assembler-
1. The assembler works in two passes.
2. The assembler checks for syntactical errors in pass1-such as invalid mnemonics or labels, or missing labels/duplicate labels.
3. The assembler checks for semantical errors in pass2- such as invalid operands/instructions.
4. Errors, if any, are mentioned in the logfile.
5. Object file and listing file are generated if the code compiles successfully.
6. Sensible Nomenclature of variables and comments.

Emulator-
* loads object file, 
    * by giving the instructions like "-before/-after" , the program can produce memory dump before/after execution.
    * by giving the instruction like "-trace", the program prints the result of program executed.
   
Structure of emulator-
1. uses mem_tab for representing memory.
2. displays the memory dump of objects after instructions are executed.
3. processes and executes instructions with the help of a series of functions.
4. produces trace file after giving "-trace" instruction.

Tests provided-
1. Bubble sort- Assembles.
2. Customtest1_error- a file that has errors to depict the error handling of assembler.cpp.
3. Customtest2- a file that has code to add two numbers.
4. Customtest3- a file that contains code to find perimeter of a rectangle.
5. Customtest4- a file that contains code to run a loop 999 times.

All the above files are provided with their object files, listing files, log files and trace files .
